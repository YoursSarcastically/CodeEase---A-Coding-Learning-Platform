  <h1 class="display-3">Variables and Datatypes </h1>
  <p class="lead">In order to use any number or information for operations like addition, substraction in java. <br> We need to create specialized places for them in the memory.<br> The places that we create are named as variables. When we store any number or information into them, we are storing data to a variable.<br>
 <br> The type of data that we store like numbers or words are called as Data types. These define the kind of data to be stored. <br>
<strong> For example </strong> <code> int a=20 </code>
<br> Here int is the integer type and a is the variable name. The data that we store into them is 20. Get the idea?<br> <br>

<strong> Can you create two variables,<br> store 2 numbers into them and find the sum of two numbers and store to a third variable? </strong>
